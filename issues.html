							<p style="text-align: justify; width: 600px; margin: auto;">
						The Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328 (datasheet).
						It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs),
						6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz ceramic resonator, a USB connection, a power jack,
						an ICSP header, and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support
					        the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power
			 			it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started. The Uno differs from all
						preceding boards in that it does not use the FTDI USB-to-serial driver chip.
						Instead, it features the Atmega16U2 (Atmega8U2 up to version R2) programmed
						as a USB-to-serial converter."Uno" means one in Italian and is named to mark
			                        the upcoming release of Arduino 1.0. The Uno and version 1.0 will be the reference
						versions of Arduino, moving forward. The Uno is the latest in a series of USB Arduino
						boards, and the reference model for the Arduino platform.</p>

						The S12C is part of Freescale's 48/52/80 pin flash-based MCU family, which delivers the power and flexibility
						of the 16-bit core to a wide range of cost and space sensitive general-purpose industrial and automotive network
						applications. Composed of standard on-chip peripherals including a 16-bit central processing unit (HCS12 CPU),
						128 KB of flash EEPROM, 4 KB of RAM, an asynchronous serial communications interface (SCI), a serial peripheral interface (SPI),
					        an 8-channel 16-bit timer module (TIM), a 6-channel 8-bit pulse width modulator (PWM), an 8-channel, 10-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC)
						and a CAN 2.0 A, B software compatible module (MSCAN12).An on-chip bandgap-based voltage regulator (Vreg) generates the internal digital
						supply voltage (VDD) for a 2.97-volt to 5.5-volt external supply range. The MC9S12C128 has full 16-bit data paths throughout.
						The inclusion of a phase-lock look (PLL) circuit allows power consumption and performance to be adjusted to suit operational requirements.
						A total of 50 I/O port pins and two input pins are available in the 80-pin package version. Up to 12 I/O port bits are available with wake-up capability from stop or wait mode.</p>

							<p style="text-align: justify; width: 600px; margin: auto;">
						The Texas Instruments MSP430 family of ultra-low-power microcontrollers consists of several devices featuring
						different sets of peripherals targeted for various applications. The architecture, combined with five low-power modes,
						is optimized to achieve extended battery life in portable measurement applications. The device features a powerful 16-bit RISC CPU,
					        16-bit registers, and constant generators that contribute to maximum code efficiency. The digitally controlled oscillator (DCO)
						allows the device to wake up from low-power modes to active mode in less than 1 us.The MSP430G2x44 series is an ultra-low-power
						mixed signal microcontroller with two built-in 16-bit timers, a universal serial communication interface (USCI),
						10-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with integrated reference and data transfer controller (DTC), and 32 I/O pins.
						Typical applications include sensor systems that capture analog signals, convert them to digital values, and then process the
						data for display or for transmission to a host system. Stand-alone radio-frequency (RF) sensor front ends are another area of application.</p>

				<h1 style="font-family: sans-serif;">Analysis</h1>

				  <p style="text-align: justify; width: 600px; margin: auto;">
				  Arduion $9.99(average), Freescale $N/A (not in stock), T.I. $N/A (not in stock),
				  All infomation on the site is a reference from the manufacturer more infomation
				  is available upon the clickable link underneath each device. After the analysis was
				  conducted it was concluded that the Arduion Uno microntroller was the better
				  device acoording to speed, features, and support from manufacturer and the device
				  is only $10 on average and the other devices are unavailable. Each controller compare to the controller used in
				  the project has more functionality, features, and capabilities.
