		Background Information
		<p style="text-align: justify; width: 600px; margin: auto;">
			I'm a native son of Tallahassee, I'm currently a senior at FAMU studying
			computer engineering. I'm interested in puring a higher education in
			electrical engineering for my master's and eventually my doctorate in
			biological or chemical engineering. My path stem from a deep rooted
			interest to purse a profession in change research and and change the
			world as we see it. In additon, I'm motivated to established a program
			(EFS-Engineering for Success) that exploits and inform the benefits of
			engineering in the community, school, and professions.
