			<h4>THE ABET STANDARD</h4>
			There is an increasing demand for continuing education, lifelong
			learning as it is often called, especially among technical workers.
			This demand is bolstered by both employers and employees themselves,
			each understanding the need to stay as up-to-date as possible in
			these rapidly changing technological times. Because ABET is
			responsible for providing quality assurance in technical higher
			education, it is not unreasonable to think that it may, too, have a
			hand in quality assurance of lifelong learning in the not-so-distant
			future. - See more at: <a href="http://www.abet.org/viewpoints">ABET</a>
