		Background Information
		<p style="text-align: justify; width: 600px; margin: auto;">
			I was born March 23, 1992, in Orlando FL. As of now, Tallahassee is
			home until I graduate from The Florida State University. I consider
			myself a hardworking individual as I like to stay busy in order to
			keep myself focused on bettering my future. In my free time I like
			to partake in playing sports or relax by playing video games. After
			completing my undergraduate degree, I want to pursue my Masters in
			Engineering. In 10 years I see myself being a prosperous Electrical
			Engineer and providing for my family.
